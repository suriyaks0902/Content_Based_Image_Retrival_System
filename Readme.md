## Content-Based Image Retrieval Project

**Project Overview:**

This project revolves around the development of a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system, which serves to efficiently retrieve images from a database based on their similarity to a target image. The aim is to explore various methodologies and techniques to achieve accurate and effective image retrieval.

**Project Structure:**

- **Baseline Matching:** This section implements a fundamental image-matching pipeline using a sum-of-squared distance metric. It serves as the foundational method for comparison with other, more advanced techniques.

- **Histogram Matching:** Utilizes both RG 2D histograms and RGB histograms for color matching. By computing color distributions and comparing them using specific distance metrics, this approach provides insights into the effectiveness of color-based image retrieval.

- **Multi-Histogram Matching:** This section explores a multihistogram approach, wherein different spatial parts of an image are represented by separate histograms. By employing custom distance metrics, this method enhances the precision of image retrieval based on specific image regions.

- **Texture and Color:** Combines color and texture histograms for image retrieval. By incorporating texture features alongside color information, this approach aims to achieve more robust and comprehensive image matching capabilities.

- **Deep Network Embeddings:** Leverages pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) embeddings for image matching. By extracting high-level features using deep learning architectures, this method offers insights into the effectiveness of learned representations for image retrieval tasks.

- **Compare DNN Embeddings and Classic Features:** Compares the performance of DNN embeddings against classic features. By evaluating the accuracy and robustness of deep learning-based approaches in comparison to traditional methods, this section provides valuable insights into the efficacy of different feature extraction techniques.

- **Custom Design:** Tailors the CBIR system to identify images of a specific category, such as bananas. By designing custom feature vectors and distance metrics, this section demonstrates the adaptability of the system to diverse image retrieval tasks.

- **Extensions:** Includes extensions such as the blue trash can and Laws filter. These extensions explore additional functionalities and enhancements to the CBIR system, showcasing its potential for addressing specific use cases and scenarios.
